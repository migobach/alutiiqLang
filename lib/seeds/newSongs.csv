It is a story about a lost drum, and when finding it, realizing that the music had been inside them all along. Featured on the Generations CD by the Alutiiq Museum, Track 19. Loren grew up near Seattle, Washington. In Washington, he had very little exposure to his Sugpiat heritage. When he moved to Alaska, he began working at the Alaska Native Heritage Center, where he learned more about his culture. He also joined an Alutiiq dance group called the Alutiiq Anguyiit or the Alutiiq Warriors. Cauyaqa Gwi Ikuk'gka is the first song Loren wrote, and it's about metaphorically finding his drum. The drum represents his entire Alutiiq heritage, and he had found that his culture has always been within him."
